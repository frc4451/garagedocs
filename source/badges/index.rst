In order to help better educate and train our students, ROBOTZ Garage has implemented a "Badge" system in order to assess and document what each student studies. 
Each badge is cummulative. Each topic within each badge will contain a module that should be completed by students, and approved by the programming team mentor.

All students that are interested in the programming team should, *at minimum*, complete Badge 1. Students who are interested in becoming Programming Lead will need to complete all modules and signed off by the programming mentor.

Given the (mostly) open-sourced nature of FRC programming, we will primarily focus on open source software that can be implemented in our robots. For software that is open-source, 
links will be utilized to provide the most up-to-date information for said topics.

Links to rubrics to return to the Programming Mentor are as follows:
